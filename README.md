# Spring Boot Starter GraphQL

Bringing GraphQL goodness to Spring Boot applications. 

This project is based on the fine work made by the folks behind the [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java) library.

**Note**: To support GraphQL's [subscriptions](http://graphql.org/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/) feature this module depends on Spring 5's WebFlux module and therefore Spring Boot 2.

# GraphQL Primer

In its most basic definition, GraphQL is a query language for your API.

Say you have a database of movies and you decide that you want to expose it to app developers to build their apps. 

One way you could go about it is by using the traditional REST API approach:

Request:

```
GET /movies
```

Response:

```
[

  {
    "id":"1",
    "title":"...",
    "synopsis":"...",
    "duration":".."
  },
  
  {
    "id":"2",
    "title":"...",
    "synopsis":"...",
    "duration":".."
  }
  
  ...
  
]
``` 
  

# Usage

Add the `spring-boot-starter-graphql` dependency to your Spring Boot app:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.creactiviti</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-graphql</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>maven-snapshots</id>
      <url>http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
      <layout>default</layout>
      <releases>
         <enabled>false</enabled>
      </releases>
      <snapshots>
         <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
   </repository>
</repositories>
```

# Kicking the tires

`spring-boot-starter-graphql` comes with a built-in `ping` query to test that everything is fine:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"query":"{ping}"}' http://localhost:8080/graphql
```

# Your first GraphQL Query

```
@Component
public class HelloWorld implements QueryBuilder {

  @Override
  public void build (Builder aBuilder) {
    aBuilder.field(Fields.field("hi")
                         .type(Scalars.GraphQLString)
                         .staticValue("Hello World"));
  }

}
```
