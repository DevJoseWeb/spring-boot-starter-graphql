# Spring Boot Starter GraphQL

Bringing GraphQL goodness to Spring Boot applications. 

This project is based on the fine work made by the folks behind the [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java) library.

**Note**: To support GraphQL's [subscriptions](http://graphql.org/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/) feature this module depends on Spring 5's WebFlux module and therefore Spring Boot 2.

# GraphQL Primer

In its most basic definition, GraphQL is a **query language** for your API.

Say you have a database of movies and you decide that you want to expose it to app developers through an API. 

One way you could go about it is by using the traditional REST API approach:

```
GET /movies?q=big
 
[

  {
    "id":"1",
    "title":"Big",
    "synopsis":"After a wish turns 12-year-old Josh Baskin into a 30-year-old man...",
    "duration":"1h44m",
    "poster":"http://...",
    "genres":[...],
    "cast":[
        {
           "name":"Tom Hanks",
           "role":"..."
        }
    ]
  },
  
  {
    "id":"2",
    "title":"The Big Lebowski",
    "synopsis":"Jeff Bridges plays Jeff Lebowski who insists on being called "the Dude,"...",
    "duration":"1h57m",
    "poster":"http://...",
    "genres":[...],
    "cast":[
        {
           "name":"...",
           "role":"..."
        }
    ]
  }
  
  ...
  
]
``` 

While this approach is totally workable it presents several challenges: 

1. **Waste**. Let's say the app developers is building a screen that gives a movie listing with a thumbnail of the movie. Since he does not need the movie synopsis, cast, genres etc. he is going to throw away a lot of data that had to be collected and tranferred over the wire. That's a lot of waste. One common way that people used to solve this problem is by introducing a `fields` query parameter to their API where you specify the fields you want to get back. This is an okay approach but comes with a significant amount of complexity to implement in the backend and does not scale very well to nested properties.

2. **Lack of standardization**. REST-based APIs are extremely custom from one to the next which means that there is no standard way to interrogate them or explore them. You are at the mercy of the API author to write proper documenations and keep these up to date in order to understand how the API works. 

3. **Evolution**. In REST world, when you need to add new properties to your response you can either take the chance of adding them and hoping nothing breaks or you can add a `/v2/movies` endpoint and add your properties there. This could quickly get out of hand and adds an additional dimension to your API which you would do great without.
  
4. **Taxing the Backend**. When you create the first version of your API it's typically nice and fast. But as you introduce more database joins, more external calls required for your response and more calculations things start slowing down. This impacts not just the new features of your apps that need the new pieces of data but any festures that use the API.

## GraphQL to the rescue  

Alternatively, we could use GraphQL to expose an API that would like something like this: 

```
POST /graphql

{
   getAllMovies {
      id
      title
   }
}
```

```
[

  {
    "id":"1",
    "title":"Big"
  },
  
  {
    "id":"2",
    "title":"The Big Lebowski",
  }
]
```

What just happened? 

1. **Waste**. Since we only want to get the movie `id` and `title` for each movie, that's exactly what we are getting back. The most of collecting and transferring the data is completely eliminated.

2. **Lack of standardization**. The GraphQL [spec](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/) provides a commong ground for agreement between API authors and client consumers. This opens the door for tools such as [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) and [Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager) to interrogate GraphQL-based APIs.

3. **Evolution**. Since GraphQL clients must *explicitly* request the pieces of information that they want to get back, there is no worry in adding new properties to the API and breaking older clients. 

4. **Taxing the backend**. Since the client is only asking for exactly what it needs, the backend it free to only perform the necessary calculations and data retrieval operations necessary to fullfill the request. 

GraphQL has many more advantages and features but I hope that this gives you a good sense of what's possible with GraphQL.

# Usage

Add the `spring-boot-starter-graphql` dependency to your Spring Boot app:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.creactiviti</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-graphql</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>maven-snapshots</id>
      <url>http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
      <layout>default</layout>
      <releases>
         <enabled>false</enabled>
      </releases>
      <snapshots>
         <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
   </repository>
</repositories>
```

# Kicking the tires

`spring-boot-starter-graphql` comes with a built-in `ping` query to test that everything is fine:

``` 
$ curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"query":"{ ping }"}' http://localhost:8080/graphql

{
  "data": {
    "ping": "OK"
  },
  "errors": [],
  "extensions": null
}
```

# Your first GraphQL Query

```
@Component
public class HelloWorld implements QueryBuilder {

  @Override
  public void build (Builder aBuilder) {
    aBuilder.field(Fields.field("hello")
                         .type(Scalars.GraphQLString)
                         .staticValue("Hi there!"));
  }

}
```

```
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"query":"{ hello }"}' http://localhost:8080/graphql

{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hi there!"
  },
  "errors": [],
  "extensions": null
}
```
